Types of scalars in sklearn

Standard scalar. Only useful when data has bell shaped(Normal)

Min Max Scalar. Converts data b/w 0 and 1 if all +ve ele -1,1
Issue - Sensitive to outliers

Robust Scalar - Takes care of outliers by using interquartile range
IQR is b/w 25 to 75. Related-boxplot. Useful to remove outliers. Hence invariable to outliers

Normaliser - Xi/root square sum

When you have data first plot a graph and see what kind of data. Then normalise according to that.
Normaliser is good when you use KNN or distance metric


Gender. Categorical data.
Unordered and ordered Types
In pandas there is getDummies
If you do One hot encoding there will be two new columns. Only one will be 1 at a time
So, one feature becomes n features where n is the number of values the Categorical variable could have taken.
This is what getDummies does. Pass it the list of columns you want to have one hot encoded. This is useful for
unordered Categorical.
For ordinal data(Ordered categorical). Use astype function in pandas.
Ex. Grades. A,A-,B,B-
df.schoolGrades.astype("category",ordered=True,categories=[B-,B,A-,A]#lowesttohighestorder in list).cat.cores
B- = 0, B =1, A-=2,A=3

If data is continuous, to convert to categorical, divide to bins. Use pd.cut
Give df and numbers of bins and attribute
pd.cut(bins=5,attr=col_name)

label_encoder. 

Plots
1. Univariate. Histogram, Bar charts. Usually all that we plot
2. Multivariate. Correlation Matrix
